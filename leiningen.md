## Leiningen

Automating Clojure projects without setting your hair on fire. [http://leiningen.org](http://leiningen.org)

### Requirements

* JDK

### Installation

While the project's [README](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen#installation) suggest that you should use _homebrew_ to perform the installation, we prefer to download the _lein script_ manually as described in the [installation instructions](http://leiningen.org/#install) because is easier to switch between lein versions.
