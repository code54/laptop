The Java Development Kit contains a complete Java Runtime Environment (JRE), plus tools for developing, debugging, and monitoring Java applications. [http://java.com](http://java.com)

### Requirements

* A browser

### Installation

OS X Mountain Lion comes with the JDK 6 installed, but we prefer the JDK 7. Download the _dmg_ file from [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html), launch it, and follow the instructions.
